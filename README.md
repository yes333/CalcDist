# CalcDist

CalcDist is a Python script for calculating distances between selected geographical locations 
which are stored in the file named 'places.csv'.

## Installation

Clone the python script and related files from GitHub:

$ git clone https://github.com/yes333/CalcDist.git

## Usage

$ cd CalcDist
$ python CalcDist.py [n]

if the argument n, a positive number, is given, the script randomly chooses n locations from the file, calculate distance between all location pairs, and print the list with ascending distance.
if the argument is ommited, all locations in the file are used.
